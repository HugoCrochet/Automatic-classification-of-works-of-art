# Automatic Classification of Works of Art

---

## üìú Project Overview

This project focuses on the **automatic classification of artworks** using state-of-the-art deep learning and clustering techniques. The goal is to classify paintings into their respective artistic styles and visualize the relationships between these styles in a meaningful way. The project leverages **ResNet** and **DenseNet** architectures for feature extraction, **t-SNE** and **UMAP** for dimensionality reduction, and **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)** for clustering.

The dataset consists of **3,060 paintings** from **100 artists**, spanning a wide range of artistic movements from the 1400s to the present day. The project aims to provide insights into the stylistic relationships between artworks and assist art historians, curators, and enthusiasts in understanding art history.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

### 1. Dataset
- **3,060 paintings** from **100 artists**.
- Covers a wide range of artistic movements (Renaissance, Baroque, Impressionism, etc.).
- Imbalanced distribution of paintings per artist.

### 2. Model Architecture
- **ResNet-18** and **DenseNet-121** pre-trained on ImageNet.
- Fine-tuned for feature extraction and classification.
- Custom fully connected layers for painter classification.

### 3. Feature Extraction
- High-level features extracted from the penultimate layer of ResNet and DenseNet.
- Manual feature extraction (color, edges) was explored but outperformed by deep learning.

### 4. Dimensionality Reduction
- **t-SNE** and **UMAP** used to project features into 2D space.
- t-SNE performed better for visualizing local structures in the dataset.

### 5. Clustering
- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)** used to cluster paintings by artistic style.
- Birthdate of artists incorporated as an additional feature to improve clustering.

## üìä Results

### Key Findings
- **t-SNE** outperformed **UMAP** in visualizing artistic styles.
- **ResNet** provided better feature extraction compared to DenseNet.
- Incorporating **birthdate** as a feature significantly improved clustering accuracy.
- Clusters aligned well with known artistic movements (e.g., Impressionism, Baroque).

### Visualizations
- **2D Maps**: Visual representations of artistic styles and their relationships.
- **Clustering**: Paintings grouped by style, with clear timelines tracing artistic movements.
